                    <p>I was part of a team, Color My World, in promoting mental health awareness and teen suicide prevention. As a board member of Color My World,
                    I led student discussions, created budget plans, and organized funds from weekly fundraisers. Our main event through an 5K Color Run, where it raised over $23,000.

                    <p>
                        I presented to the Northville Public Schools Board of Education on ways of addressing mental health to younger audiences. Once approved,
                    I led several online Zoom discussions for classes of elementary students during COVID-19 quarantine.
